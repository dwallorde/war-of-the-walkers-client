TechFreqs Pickup Plants V2.7, for 7 days to die V2.0 ,allows you to pickup Crops or Plants by pressing the E key. Pretty self-explanatory; you can also pickup deadplants or dead crops aswell but that will give you plant fibers per each picked plant/crop. This also allows you to pickup said crops or plants from POIs also instead of punching them to pickup the plants resources and gain
a seed or two probably is 0.5 chance or 1.0 chance.



Latest Changelog:
V2.7(V2.0)
- Updated for 2.0


How it works:
Using the append feature and applying the can pickup property for the mature plants or poi crops/ready to be harvested plants.
Using <append> makes it pretty safe to install and uninstall, especially since it's kept minimal with just the CanPickup="true" property value.

EAC must be disabled, although i hope in the future that can be changed, as for now DLLS are not EAC supported however XML has no issue, as for this mod its DLL so its unfortunately not EAC compatible.
THIS IS CLIENT SIDE ONLY but maybe perhaps this is also, server side and client side compatibility?
CAN CONFIRM! server side and Client Side works! BUT server and each client must have the mod or dll installed on each.
No further setup needed. Enjoy!

As for this version, V2.3 Revamped:
EXTRA LOGS for debugging! as well as working server support!
 just copy and paste the same mod into servers mod folder and have it on per client connecting to the server to pickup crops!

since old V2.3 version was bugged with gettype issue with a mushroom plant another typo THAT old revamped fixes that issue... and MORE! 
-Allows you to pickup crops just as you would harvest them with the stone axe and received seeds, crops
-bonuses from living of the land perks!

As for this Version V2.2:
-Fixed localization issue , crops should have normal names! but also affected in creative menu , should leave the scientific name intact, but also added Small and Medium  Mushroom names to mushroom01 and mushroom02 and for Dead Plants Aswell,
-Crops or Plants dont have the POI label within the name next to each either.

AND EVEN Now using English, and including many languages

As for this Version V2.0:
-Added Crops and Plants to enable pickup, but with iffy scientific names in place instead of normal names but has perk bonuses still working, but didn't have dead plants as a feature to be picked up.

As for this Version V1.0:
