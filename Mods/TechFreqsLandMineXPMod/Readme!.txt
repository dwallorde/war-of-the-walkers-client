The TechFreq's Land Mine XP Mod V2.2(V2.1), for 7 Days to Die allows players to gain XP from enemy zombies and most hostile animals killed by land mines. The XP distribution is proximity-based, meaning that if a player is near the traps when a kill occurs, they will receive XP—now rocking configurable , 150 XP per kill & 30m radius file similar to the spike trap xp mod.

Latest Changelog:
V2.2(v2.1)
- Updated for v2.1 b7 of 7days to die
- adds other debug checks for the methods to fix the entity name, but thats about it same for shared spike trap xp mod


Previous Changelog:
V2.1(V2.0)
- Updated for V2.0 of  7days to die
- removed redundant code for patching on entity instead to patch on block for landmine detection 
- updated code for tooltip error fix on new game version
- still server side compatible if installed on both


Key Features:
Current Status:
✅ Basic XP system shines at 150 XP per kill
✅ Shared XP is still TBA it works but ONLy if Client has it installed on their PC 
✅ Enemy animals like zombie dogs and bears grant XP, no glitches
✅ Tooltip pops up for local players— “Gained 150 XP from land mine kill!”
✅ Improve logging and feedback so each player gets clear confirmation of earned XP in LOGs via F1 without so much log clutter
✅ Fixed XP inconsistencies and anything else that needs adjustments...


If a single player is near the spike traps, they receive XP (100 XP per kill).
If multiple players are nearby, the mod attempts to determine who to send the XP to,but if not in distance of the mines, no xp will be given 
If a player is far away, it will show in logs upon entity kill and determine whether or not they should recieve it

THIS IS CLIENT SIDE ONLY but maybe perhaps this is also, server side and client side compatibility?
No further setup needed. Enjoy!

Previous Changelog:
As for V2:
In this update, same features as previous ONLY difference is that it detects just landmines, as previous it was detecting spike kills in the logs for some odd reason ,additional debugging logs thats useful for entity id, time and xyz coordinates of said mines around the player and kills in game, improved config json not just for radius but now adjustable detection proximity radius and xp amount.


Notes:
P.S dont mind the 10,000 xp, i have my loot abundance to 1 million percent for a debug world, using another mod called extended game settings, for testing.. ill upload more pics later for default xp value.. and functionality but this is a tough project as it is aswell..  but just to put that out there.

cross posted onto 7daystodiemods, checkout TechFreq on nexusmods for further updates on their and private dms for mod suggestions or feedback!


As for V1:
allows players to gain XP from enemy zombies and most hostile animals killed by land mines. The XP distribution is proximity-based, meaning that if a player is near the traps when a kill occurs, they will receive XP, inconsistent xp sharing however configurable json file.
